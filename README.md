# 6124739_sands_python
the goal of this project is to define some signal, make it go through a system (which will modify it) and then plot the results. The two functions created were a sin function (signals.py) and a unit step function (signal_2.py). Additionaly, test functions have been created in each respective file. They are both tested in test_my_function.py. 
In run.py, we import the sin and unit step function, shift, and then plot them.
The pyproject.toml makes it easier to download the package and understand its working.
The cos_signal.py was a first try at creating a function and shifting it, but is not relevent anymore to the main project.
